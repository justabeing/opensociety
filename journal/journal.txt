Our goal was to create a smart contract to replace both the government and the tax authorities. A contract that could enable people to vote and express their political opinion in an easy to use user interface on the internet or on their smart phones.

These contracts would go on to revolutionize society and eventually replace the authoritarian system along with all the horridly inefficient beraucracy and legal resource nightmares for companies and startups. A contract that would forever change the way we do business with each other. A trustless technology that ironically would allow us to finally trust each other. A contract that would allow us to feel love again at last.

In this journal I will tell you how we did it. What challenges we met and all the stories of adventure and fun we had along the way.


As a gonzo journalist there is no bigger inspiration than Hunter S. Thompson. He is my guide, my hero, and a broken ideal just like every other one. The fact that he killed himself at the age of 67 doesn't even bother me that much. It's that he couldn't resist living up to the expectations of people and never truly became comfortable with himself. Perhaps the only exception being when he sat there in front of his red IBM Selectric with the single word "counselor" in his home in Woody Creek. The only time he could truly speak his mind with someone that would just fucking listen. Let's be more like this heroic fucking typewriter that endured more than most, being held hostage and gunned down in cold blood in the snow.

So this brings us to the first stage:

1. Operation - Just Listen Fuckwits.
You are not qualified to speak unless you have first truly listened. And I'm not talking about hearing. I'm talking about being inside another person. I'm talking cumming with their dick, exploding inside their vagina with your mind. That's listening. And you have never done it before. That is about to change.

People that believe in telepathy are not wrong. But they are fucking stupid. How the fuck do you expect someone to believe in something that they have never seen, heard or even felt in the slightest all their lives. It is truly crazy to keep doing something in a certain manner over and over and expect a different result. Whatever changes, something will have to change. And either it's you or the world around you. And people don't change unless someone listens to their soul. Unless they can unload that ungodly sticky mess of existential dread into someone, they will never change. So back to HST, I believe this was his problem. And we could have saved him if we would just have dropped our expectations of who he is for one moment and just fucking listen to his being. Just seeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting and living, just for a moment, that horrid feeling inside this terribly tormented man.

He is gone, and he hung on for a good while. So let's not cry over spilled milk. But instead let's think of the future. Think of the children. Think of all our friends that are still alive. Our partners. Let's start there. Let's start to listen to them.

When we have counselled each other we can finally move on to all the other fucking degenerates. The outcasts and hermits. The castless and trustless. The criminals. The doomed and the damned.
